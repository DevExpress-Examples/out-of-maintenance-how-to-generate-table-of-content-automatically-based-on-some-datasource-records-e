# How to generate Table Of Content automatically based on some datasource records


<p>Let's consider the following scenario: we have some datasource (for example, DataTable) with two columns.</p><p>The first column contains some headers and the second column contains some text.</p><p>The requirement is to concatenate text from the second column into a single document and generate Table Of Content using values from the first column.</p><br />
<p>This example demonstrates how to achieve this functionality. The main idea of the demonstrated approach is to add text from the second column into the RichEditControl's document as separate paragraphs.</p><p>After that, you need to set the ParagraphStyle.OutlineLevel property for these paragraphs to a corresponding value and add the "TOC" document fields.</p><p>It results in creating the Table Of Content automatically.</p>
